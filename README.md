# ZendDemo
A demonstration of a small website done in the Zend framework.

Notes To Consider: 

1) The MySql database for the cars is located in the "/docs" directory. As this project was made using a localhost (with the database handled by PHPMyAdmin, just simply import the database.

2) In the Library/Zend directory, only the required files and directories are present. All else is deleted to save space.

3) As I am new to Zend, this is only a basic example. I am especially having trouble with the URLs, in which the car page segment shows, for example, RealAutos/public/car-page/view/id/67, when ideally it should be RealAutos/car-page/67.
Any feedback on how to work around this would be appreciated (no really. I spent days trying to do this).
